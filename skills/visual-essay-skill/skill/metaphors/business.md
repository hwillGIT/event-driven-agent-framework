# Metaphor Engine: BUSINESS / STRATEGY

**Concept**: Mapping corporate growth, time, and execution to tangible progress markers.
**Use When**: Explaining roadmaps, quarterly goals, market fit, or team alignment.

*   **Time/Progress** -> `Road / Highway / Railway / River Delta`
*   **Goal/Target** -> `Summit / North Star / Bullseye / Finish Line`
*   **Obstacle** -> `Mountain Pass / Toll Booth / Storm`
*   **Growth/Scale** -> `Skyscraper Construction / Expanding City / Rocket Launch`

## Visual Vocabulary
`winding roads`, `milestones`, `clocks`, `calendars`, `shipping containers`, `cranes`, `suspension bridges`, `lighthouses`, `relay batons`.

## Special Logic: TIMELINES
When visualizing a Timeline:
1.  **Do NOT** try to render text dates (e.g., "Q1 2024") inside the image pixels.
2.  **DO** use visual sequencing:
    *   *Linear*: A road stretching to the horizon with distinct markers (stones, signs).
    *   *Cyclical*: A watch face or season wheel.
    *   *Step*: A staircase or ladder.
3.  **Overlay**: Place the specific dates/labels in the **LOCKED Text** layer, not the image prompt.
